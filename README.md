# How to submit your solution

1. Get a GitHub account, if you don't have one already.
2. Clone this repository with the "Fork" button in the top right
   corner of the page (if you're not reading this on GitHub, go to
   <https://github.com/lballabio/IMT2018> first).
3. Check out your clone to your machine.
4. Enter the folder corresponding to your project and modify the
   contained files.  Feel free to add Visual Studio projects,
   Makefiles, or any other file you might need. You can also add your
   report there.
5. When you want me to see your progress (ideally, as soon as you have
   a sketch of the solution), push your changes to your clone and
   submit a pull request.  This is only needed the first time;
   afterwards, push the new changes to your fork and they will be
   added to the existing pull request automatically.

More detailed instructions for forking and creating pull requests are
available at <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo> and
<https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>.  A basic guide
to GitHub is at <https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/>.

Good luck!
